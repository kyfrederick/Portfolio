# About
## Let me introduce myself 
- I am a Environmental Engineering undergraduate at Cornell. While trying to bring my teamâ€™s clean water tech to more communities in Honduras, I became inspired by how non-philanthropic capital has the power to drive scalable value and mobilize economic opportunity by fueling the gifts of others. I want to wield such a critical force for effecting change through sustainable investing.
